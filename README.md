# alertJS
## js alert library
### Getting Started
In the head section of the HTML file inport alertJS by using the code below:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="alertJS.css">
<script src="alertJS.js"></script>
```
Then, in the body section type the code below to set up the alert box:
```
<div id="alertJS" class="overlay"></div>
```
Now for the fun part: the JavaScript.
You can set the alert's content with the 'makeAlert()' function.
The first part of the input is the head section. The second is the body:
```
makeAlert('Head', 'Body')
```
To open the alert use the 'openAlert()' function:
```
openAlert()
```
